CARNA 0.1 (Constraint Alignment of RNA)
=======================================

Compile 
=======

Carna requires Gecode 3.2.2 and the CImg library. To install Carna,
get these first. Make sure to build Gecode with qt-support
(i.e. configure --enable-qt)

If gecode library and headers are not in the default path, you need to
set the gecode installation directory and gecode source directory
explicitly.

Compile Carna by

./configure --prefix=<installation-path> GECODE_HOME=<path-to-gecode-installation-dir> GECODE_SRC_HOME=<path-to-gecode-src-dir>

make


If the configure cannot find your CImg library, you can add it to
CXXFLAGS-variable like this example

export CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/CImg/1.3.2/

You might also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the folder,
where the gecode library is installed, like

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/FOO/BAR/lib
