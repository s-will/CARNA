Some bug fixes
(V0.2.3)
Modify handling of time-limit, such that a first solution is always
searched and written, i.e. the search will never be interrupted by time-out
before first solution.
(V0.2.4)
Fix bug in branching strategy
Change enumeration, such that traces that yield new lower bounds immediately generate solutions
(V0.3)
