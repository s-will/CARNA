CARNA 1.2.8 (Constraint Alignment of RNA)
=======================================

Compile and Install
===================

Carna requires the Vienna RNA package >=2.1.1, LocARNA >=1.8.0 , and
Gecode >=4.2.0. Please get those packages, and install prior to
CARNA. If you need graphic search (gist), make sure that Gecode builds
with qt and gist support (check configure messages).

Carna can be installed by the typical sequence ./configure; make; make
install However, if required packages are installed to non-standard
locations, you will have to specify them:

If gecode library and headers are not in the default path, you need to
set the gecode installation directory (<path-to-gecode-inst-dir>)
explicitly. Thus, call
export GECODE_HOME=<path-to-gecode-inst-dir>

Similarily, it can be necessary to set the path to the
pkgconfig directory of the locarna library
(<path-to-locarna-lib-pkgcfg>). For example, if locarna was installed
to $LOCARNA_HOME, this is $LOCARNA_HOME/lib/pkgconfig and contains
LocARNA-1.3.pc.
Thus, call
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path-to-locarna-lib-pkgcfg>

Typically, it also is necessary to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the folder(s),
where the gecode and locarna libraries are installed, like:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/FOO/BAR/lib


Finally, compile Carna and install to <installation-path> by

./configure --prefix=<installation-path>
make
make install


If you need gist and the configure cannot find the installed CImg library, one
can specify its path by:
export CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/CImg/1.3.2/
