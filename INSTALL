CARNA 1.3.0 (Constraint Alignment of RNA)
=======================================

Compile and Install
===================

This document describes howto install CARNA from source
code. Currently, there are no binary distributions or precompiled
packages available.

CARNA has depenencies to the Vienna RNA package, the LocARNA package
and Gecode. This release of CARNA was adapted to work with Vienna RNA
package 2.1.9, LocARNA 1.8.6, and Gecode 4.4.0. While other vesrsions
may work, please use exactly the same software versions to avoid
incompatibilities.

As a special feature, CARNA supports interactive graphical search via
Gecode's gist, which has additional requirements. Since this feature
is NOT necessary for computing alignments with CARNA, it is disabled
in the standard installation. Unless gist support is required, one can
ignore the steps indicated by GIST ONLY.

1) Install the Vienna RNA package

   The package is available at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/
   Precompiled packages are provided for many platforms.

2) Install LocARNA 1.8.6
  
  The LocARNA package is available at
  http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/LocARNA/

  Please follow the installation instructions to compile and install via        
 ./configure; make; make install.

3) Install Gecode

  The site http://www.gecode.org/download.html provides packages and
  source. When installing from source (via ./configure; make; make
  install), one can avoid the dependency to Qt by deactivating gist
  (configure option --disable-gist.)
        
  GIST ONLY: when installing from a package, make sure that it
  includes Qt/Gist-support. When installing from source, keep gist
  activated (default); this requires to have Qt installed.

4) Install CARNA

  GIST ONLY: for gist support, make sure to have CImg
   (http://cimg.eu/) and libX11 installed. These libraries can be
   installed from packages on most platforms (e.g. packages cimg-dev
   and libx11-dev on Ubuntu 15.10).
        
  To install CARNA from source, get CARNA-X.Y.Z.tar.gz from
  http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~will/Software/CARNA and run the
  commands

        tar xzf CARNA-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        cd CARNA-X.Y.Z
        ./configure
        make
        make install

  Unless gist support is required, please ignore respective warnings
  or configure with option --disable-gist.

  Non-standard installation paths:
  -------------------------------  
    Usually, these commands are sufficient if all required packages
    are installed in standard locations and CARNA shall be installed
    to /usr/local/.
  
    Otherwise, one has to provide specific options to the ./configure
    command and/or set environment variables. This is described below:

    If gecode library and headers are not in the default path, one
    needs to set the gecode installation directory
    (<path-to-gecode-inst-dir>) explicitly. Thus, call export
    GECODE_HOME=<path-to-gecode-inst-dir>

    Similarily, it can be necessary to set the path to the pkgconfig
    directory of the locarna library
    (<path-to-locarna-lib-pkgcfg>). For example, if locarna was
    installed to $LOCARNA_HOME, this is $LOCARNA_HOME/lib/pkgconfig
    and contains LocARNA-1.3.pc.  Thus, call export
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path-to-locarna-lib-pkgcfg>

    Finally, it can be necessary to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the
    folder(s), where the gecode and locarna libraries are installed,
    like: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/FOO/BAR/lib
