Dear David Cohen,

we submitted the final version of our paper number 97

Alessandro Dal Pal, Mathias MÃ¶hl, and Sebastian Will. A Propagator for
Maximum Weight String Alignment with Arbitrary Pairwise Dependencies

and the copyright from via easychair.


We carefully edited the paper due to the reviewers comments as
described below. We did a few other minor editing mainly to resolve
typos, which is not mentioned explicitely.


Notably, we changed "matching" to "alignment" according to reviewer 3
all over the text. This includes a change of the title.

In the Introduction, we clarified the concepts of arcs and/or
dependencies in paragraph 2 (Reviewer 3) and added references to
related work in CP that uses DP for propagation, including work on
soft constraints, which is even similar in the way that DP-based
propagation in an optimization setting in paragraph 3.

In Section Constraint Model, we clarified the relation between
valuations and alignments (see review 1). In the third paragraph, we
explicitely stated that the sequences are parameters of the
constraints (see review 3)

In Section 4 "Problem Decomposition", we explain the difference
between arcs and dependencies (see review 3) and changed the footnote
(see review 3).

Furthermore, in response to reviewer 1, we added details in Section
Results to explain the time limit (see review 1) and how the data set
of RFam families was generated (see review 1).

In the discussion, we avoid the use of the term "tractable" in a
misleading way (see review 1).



Best regards,

Sebastian
