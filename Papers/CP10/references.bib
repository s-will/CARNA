  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of functional non-coding RNA 
                  sequences has led to an increasing interest in algorithms 
                  related to RNA analysis. Traditional sequence alignment 
                  algorithms, however, fail at computing reliable alignments 
                  of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation of 
                  RNA sequences largely determines their function, and 
                  therefore RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural 
                  information into account. RESULTS: We present a graph-based 
                  representation for sequence-structure alignments, which we 
                  model as an integer linear program (ILP). We sketch how we 
                  compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the ILP using 
                  methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results 
                  on a recently published benchmark set for RNA alignments. 
                  CONCLUSION: The implementation of our algorithm yields 
                  better alignments in terms of two published scores than the 
                  other programs that we tested: This is especially the case 
                  with an increasing number of input sequences. Our program

  abstract = {Arc-annotated sequences are useful in representing the 
                  structural information of RNA sequences. In general, RNA 
                  secondary and tertiary structures can be represented as a 
                  set of nested arcs and a set of crossing arcs, respectively. 
                  Since RNA functions are largely determined by molecular 
                  confirmation and therefore secondary and tertiary 
                  structures, the comparison between RNA secondary and 
                  tertiary structures has received much attention recently. In 
                  this paper, we propose the notion of edit distance to 
                  measure the similarity between two RNA secondary and 
                  tertiary structures, by incorporating various edit 
                  operations performed on both bases and arcs (i.e., 
                  base-pairs). Several algorithms are presented to compute the 
                  edit distance between two RNA sequences with various arc 
                  structures and under various score schemes, either exactly 
                  or approximately, with provably good performance. 
                  Preliminary experimental tests confirm that our definition 
                  of edit distance and the computation model are among the 
                  most reasonable ones ever studied in the literature.}

A novel application of dynamic programming to the folding problem for RNA
enables one to calculate the full equilibrium partition function for
secondary structure and the probabilities of various substructures. In
particular, both the partition function and the probabilities of all base
pairs are computed by a recursive scheme of polynomial order N3 in the
sequence length N. The temperature dependence of the partition function
gives information about melting behavior for the secondary structure. The
pair binding probabilities, the computation of which depends on the
partition function, are visually summarized in a "box matrix" display and
this provides a useful tool for examining the full ensemble of probable
alternative equilibrium structures. The calculation of this ensemble
representation allows a proper application and assessment of the
predictive power of the secondary structure method, and yields important
information on alternatives and intermediates in addition to local
information about base pair opening and slippage. The results are
illustrated for representative tRNA, 5S RNA, and self-replicating and
self-splicing RNA molecules, and allow a direct comparison with enzymatic
structure probes. The effect of changes in the thermodynamic parameters on
the equilibrium ensemble provides a further sensitivity check to the
predictions.  ------------------------------

  abstract = {Many computational problems concerning RNA
                  pseudoknot structures, most prominently their
                  prediction and alignment, are NP-hard. For structure
                  prediction, several algorithms have been proposed
                  that are restricted to certain classes of
                  pseudoknots in order to run efficiently. We present
                  a general scheme that yields an efficient alignment
                  algorithm for arbitrary classes of pseudoknots that
                  can be predicted efficiently by dynamic
                  programming. Moreover, we show that such an
                  alignment algorithm benefits from restrictions to
                  certain structure classes in the same way as
                  structure prediction algorithms do. We look at five
                  of these classes in greater detail. Compared to the
                  respective structure prediction algorithm, the time
                  and space complexity of the obtained alignment
                  algorithm is increased by only a linear factor. For
                  four of the classes, there do not exist alignment
                  algorithms so far. For the fifth, most general
                  class, our algorithm improves the time complexity
                  compared to the best algorithm known so far, from
                  $O(n^5m^5)$ time to $O(nm^6)$, where $n$ and $m$ are
                  the length of the two aligned sequences. Finally, we
                  apply the fastest of the generated algorithms with
                  complexity $O(nm^4)$ time and $O(nm^2)$ space to
                  comparative de-novo prediction of pseudoknots.}

                  snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs
                  that are characterized by structural similarities, and
                  typically consist ofmultiple RNA families. Recent advances
                  in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics
                  have produced very large sets of putative non-coding RNAs
                  and regulatory RNA signals. For many ofthem, evidence for
                  stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures
                  has been derived, and at least approximate models of their
                  structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of
                  these hypo-thetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established
                  families or classes. We present here a structure-based
                  clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative
                  RNA classesfrom genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The
                  LocARNA tool implements a novel variant of theSankoff
                  algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several
                  thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust
                  against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of
                  the input data with unstructured ornon-conserved
                  sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based
                  clustering approach on the sequences of the
                  RFAM-seedalignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a
                  previously published set of 3332 predicted structured
                  elements in the Ciona intestinalis genomes (Missal et al.,
                  Bioinformatics 21(S2), i77-i78). In addition torecovering
                  e.g. tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies
                  several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA
                  candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for
                  which to-date norepresentative has been experimentally

                  great interest to help solving problems as different
                  as phylogeny reconstruction, prediction of molecule
                  folding and identification of a function common to a
                  set of molecules. Lin et al. [6] proposed to define a
                  similarity criterion between RNA structures using a
                  concept of edit distance ; they named the
                  corresponding problem Edit. Recently, Blin et al. [3]
                  showed that another problem, the Longest
                  Arc-Preserving Common Subsequence problem (or Lapcs),
                  is in fact a subproblem of Edit. This relationship
                  between those two problems induces the hardness of
                  what was the last open case for the Edit problem,
                  Edit(Nested,Nested), which corresponds to computing
                  the edit distance between two secondary structures
                  without pseudoknots. Nevertheless, Lapcs is a very
                  restricted subproblem of Edit: in particular, it
                  corresponds to a given system of editing costs, whose
                  biological relevance can be discussed ; hence, giving
                  a more precise categorization of the computational
                  complexity of the Edit problem remains of interest. In
                  this paper, we answer this question by showing that
                  Edit(Nested,Nested) is NP-complete for a large class
                  of instances, not overlapping with the ones used in
                  the proof for Lapcs, and which represent more
                  biologically relevant cost systems.},
